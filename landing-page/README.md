# The Landing page project


## Project Description

The project is multisection webpage with a top navigation bar and a scroll to the top button.  
The navigation bar is dynamically created in the javaScript code; if a new section is added to the HTML file the script will automatically
create a new link in the navigation bar.  
The scroll to the top button is only visible when the user is not at the top of the webpage.  
The script will repeatedly identify the section that the user is viewing and add unique css style class to it.
